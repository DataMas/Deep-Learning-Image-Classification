<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The repository includes Neural Networks implemented using Keras for image classification. Two datasets have been used, the Sign Language Digits Dataset and the Diabetic Retinopathy Arranged Dataset. Both datasets can be found on Kaggle:
- Diabetic Retinopathy Arranged Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/amanneo/diabetic-retinopathy-resized-arranged
- Sign Language Digits Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/ardamavi/sign-language-digits-dataset

The project was implemented for the purposes of the Pattern Recognition course of the 9th semester of DUTh.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
To get started make sure you have downloaded the CA file containing the code files.

### Running experiments
To run you wn experiments using this implementation of epidemic modeling:
- Run spreading.m file to simulate an epidemic spreading without vaccination
  - Configure population and virus characteristics variables
- Run vaccination.m file to simulate the effects of vacination
  - Configure population, virus and vaccination characteristics variables
